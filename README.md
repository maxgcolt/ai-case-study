# FREENOME CASE STUDY


## Overview and Origin

* Name of company:

Freenome

* When was the company incorporated?:

2014

* Who are the founders of the company?:

Riley Ennis and Vijay Pande.

* How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?:

The moniker Freenome most likely comes from a conjunction of two words, 'free' and 'nome'. They chose this unique name because of their mission as a company, the 'free' referring to their goal to make early cancer detection technology widely accessible to all, and the 'nome' referring to the human genome, which is analyzed to find signs of cancer.

* How is the company funded? How much funding have they received? 

Freenome is a privately owned company that relies on private funding and investment. Its procured over 1.2 billion dollars since it began in 2014, the majority of which has come from Roche Holding AG.

## Business Activities

* What specific problem is the company or project trying to solve?:

Early detection of all kinds of cancers in their most treatable stages, and ro make cancer screening easy and accessible for everyone.

* Who is the company's intended customer? Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers? 

According to www.cancer.gov, 'Approximately 40.5% of men and women will be diagnosed with cancer at some point during their lifetimes (based on 2017–2019 data).' This is a startling 2 in 5, almost one third of the population of the United States will have some form of cancer in their lifetime, meaning the amount of people who will benefit from early screening technology like this could very well reach hundreds of millions within just a five year period.

* What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)

They are one of the only companies in the liquid biopsy industry that utilize machine learning and artificial intelligence to analyze cancer markers, which allows them to analyze data more accurately and much more quickly. They also use multi nome, analyzing multiple kinds of genome analysis in one test to be able to verify a wide variety of warning signs.

* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing&mdash;you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)

Freenome uses machine learning models that have been trained on biomarker cancer data, allowing for the models to identify suspicious molecular patterns in a patients liquid biopsy results. This paired with their multinome approach allow for a wide variety of tumor and non-tumor tissue to be analyzed for early warning signs. 

## Landscape

* What field is the company in? 

Liquid biopsies and cancer screening through multiple methods of genome study.

* What have been the major trends and innovations of this field over the last 5&ndash;10 years?

There has been a flurry of new innovations in cancer diagnosis and early diagnostic screenings in the past decade. A few notable innovations include liquid biopsies themselves, which are new cancer tests that analyze ctDNA (tumor cells circulating in the bloodstream) for a noninvasive way to analyze cancer markers. , which allow for much less invasive ways to monitor and detect cancers. Something that Freenome themselves specifically focus on is at the cutting edge of cancer diagnosis technology, which is a combination of two new methods for early detection oncology. They use both multi-omics and machine learning, a novel approach to cancer diagnosis, referenced earlier in separate parts in this case study.

* What are the other major companies in this field?

GRAIL and Guardant Health are both working on similar technology, doing trials with their own specific forms of testing kits to analyze patients' blood. However neither of them have (at least publicly) begun to use AI or machine learning technologies for analysis, or use the multinomic approach that Freenome has been utilizing for the past few years.

## Results

* What has been the business impact of this company so far?

They are revolutionizing the industry through cutting edge technology that will force innovation in the companies around it.

* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this field use to measure success? 

How is your company performing based on these metrics?
While both Guardant and GRAIL are publicly traded companies, we can look at their stock prices to get a general idea of the market opinion of these two companies, and they've both been losing value for the last six months steadily.

* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same field? 
Despite raising 254 million dollars earlier this year, in April they laid off 20% of their workforce after their colorectal test performed poorly, with the read out of their test not meeting expectations with accuracy. 

## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)

A wider variety of tests for multiple cancers, such as brain, blood, bone etc, obviously easier said than done but with a more diverse collection of tests to offer they could save many more lives. Machine learning models can be trained to identify and detect any early stage signs with all of these kinds of cancer.

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?

As stated above, a wider selection of tests would allow for many more people to benefit from this technology.

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?

Machine learning models can be trained to identify and detect any early stage signs with all of these kinds of cancer.

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?
]
Freenome has already been using machine learning in their previous tests, so they have the experience and hardware needed to use machine learning.
